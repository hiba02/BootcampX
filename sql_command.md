## Create a Test Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE test_db;

\c test_db;


```

## Create a Sample Table

Create a table, famous_people:

```sql
CREATE TABLE famous_people (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50),
  last_name VARCHAR(50),
  birthdate DATE
);

```

## BootcampX

```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE bootcampx;
-- Start using the database
\c bootcampx;
```

### make file 
create_table.sql 

```sql
CREATE TABLE cohorts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  start_date DATE,
  end_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE students (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255),
  phone VARCHAR(32),
  github VARCHAR(255),
  start_date DATE,
  end_date DATE,
  cohort_id INTEGER REFERENCES cohorts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

```
### Add tables to the database
1. bootcampx=# psql bootcampx < create_table.sql;

2. \i migrations/students_cohorts.sql  (change file name)


### To check tables
```sql
\dt
```

### Take a look at all of the data in the students and cohorts tables

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
SELECT * FROM cohorts;
```

### Download sql files

[Students](http://bit.ly/2Z0fN4t)

[Cohorts](http://bit.ly/300nIQy)

* Create a folder named seeds inside the BootcampX folder.
Download both of the .sql files using wget.
* Download both of the .sql files using wget.

```
wget http://bit.ly/2Z0fN4t -O seeds/students.sql

wget http://bit.ly/300nIQy -O seeds/cohorts.sql
```

### Run the cohorts.sql and students.sql files against the bootcampx database

Inside the psql session,

```sql
\i seeds/cohorts.sql

\i seeds/students.sql
```

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM students;
```

### git submit code

â€¦or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# BootcampX" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/hiba02/BootcampX.git
git push -u origin master

make new repository named 'BootcampX'

```
vagrant [BootcampX]> git init

vagrant [BootcampX]> git add .

vagrant [BootcampX]> git commit -m "Intialization"

vagrant [BootcampX]> git remote add origin git@github.com:hiba02/BootcampX.git

vagrant [BootcampX]> git push -u origin master

```


### Create a new directory in BootcampX called 0_selects

We will then execute the query against our database using **\i filename.sql** from within our psql session.

```
vagrant [BootcampX]> mkdir 0_selects
```

### Create a New SQL File

```
vagrant [0_selects]> touch 1_students_without_github.sql
```
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, cohort_id
FROM students
WHERE github IS NULL
ORDER BY cohort_id
```

### Execute the SQL file
In a psql session

```
\i 0_selects/1_students_without_github.sql
```

## BootcampX Queries 1
* Get the names of all of the students from a single cohort.

```
vagrant [BootcampX]> mkdir 1_queries
```

```sql
SELECT id, name 
FROM students 
WHERE cohort_id = 1
ORDER BY name;
```

### Caution: ORDER BY should be located in after WHERE caluse

* Select the total number of students who were in the first 3 cohorts.

```sql
SELECT count(id)
FROM students 
WHERE cohort_id IN (1,2,3);
```

### Get all of the students that don't have an email or phone number

```sql
SELECT name, id, cohort_id
FROM students
WHERE email IS NULL
OR phone IS NULL;
```

### Get all of the students without a gmail.com or phone number

```sql
SELECT name, id, email, cohort_id
FROM students
WHERE email NOT LIKE '%gmail.com'
AND phone IS NULL;
```

### Get all of the students currently enrolled

```sql
SELECT name, id, cohort_id
FROM students
WHERE end_date IS NULL
ORDER BY cohort_id;
```

### Get all graduates without a linked Github account

```sql
SELECT name, email, phone
FROM students
WHERE github IS NULL
AND end_date IS NOT NULL;
```

* execution
```
\i 1_queries/1_queries.sql
```



## BootcampX Assignments

```
vagrant [migrations]> mkdir assignments_submissions.sql
```

### Write the CREATE TABLE statements for the assignments and a assignment_submissions tables

```
vagrant [migrations]> touch assignments_submissions.sql
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE assignments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  content TEXT,
  day INTEGER,
  chapter INTEGER,
  duration INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE assignment_submissions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  assignment_id INTEGER REFERENCES assignments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  student_id INTEGER REFERENCES students(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  duration FLOAT,
  submission_date DATE
);
```

```
\i migrations/assignments_submissions.sql

\dt
```



### Download the .sql files with the fake data in them

Within the seeds directory, download both of the .sql files using wget.

```
wget http://bit.ly/2N1uWQy -O seeds/assignments_seeds.sql

wget http://bit.ly/33vpmMb -O seeds/assignment_submissions_seeds.sql
```



### Run the assignments_seeds.sql and assignment_submissions_seeds.sql files against the bootcampx database

Inside your psql session

```sql
CREATE TABLE assignment_submissions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  assignment_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  student_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  duration FLOAT,
  submission_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE assignments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
  day INTEGER,
  chapter INTEGER,
  duration INTEGER
);
```
* CAUTION: data format changed

```sql
\i seeds/assignments_seeds.sql
\i seeds/assignment_submissions_seeds.sql
```





### JOINing Tables

```sql
SELECT students.name as student_name, email, cohorts.name as cohort_name
FROM students JOIN cohorts ON cohort_id = cohorts.id;
```

* Every JOIN must also have an ON.


### INNER JOIN

* same as JOIN

```sql
SELECT students.name as student_name, email, cohorts.name as cohort_name
FROM students INNER JOIN cohorts ON cohorts.id = cohort_id;
```

* If the foreign key is NULL, the row will not be included in the result of an INNER JOIN.
* Most of the time, like 99% of the time, we want to use an INNER JOIN. 



### OUTER JOIN

* 3 different types of OUTER JOIN
* error occurs witout LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL

```sql
SELECT students.name as student_name, email, cohorts.name as cohort_name
FROM students LEFT OUTER JOIN cohorts ON cohorts.id = cohort_id;

SELECT students.name as student_name, email, cohorts.name as cohort_name
FROM students RIGHT OUTER JOIN cohorts ON cohorts.id = cohort_id;

SELECT students.name as student_name, email, cohorts.name as cohort_name
FROM students FULL OUTER JOIN cohorts ON cohorts.id = cohort_id;
```


* The LEFT OUTER JOIN will return all of the students, even ones without a cohort_id.

* The RIGHT OUTER JOIN will return all cohorts, even ones without any students enrolled.

* The FULL OUTER JOIN will return all cohorts and all students, even when there is no match.


* When we write a LEFT OUTER JOIN or a RIGHT OUTER JOIN, we can omit the word OUTER. 



### A student may have started in one cohort, gotten sick, and had to finish in a different cohort. We'll call this type of student a rollover student.

```sql
SELECT students.name, cohorts.name, cohorts.start_date as cohort_start_date, students.start_date as student_start_date
FROM students
JOIN cohorts ON cohort_id = cohorts.id
WHERE cohorts.start_date != students.start_date;
```





## BootcampX Queries II - JOIN

### Get the total amount of time that a student has spent on all assignments.
This should work for any student but use 'Ibrahim Schimmel' for now.
Select only the total amount of time as a single column.



```sql
bootcampx=# SELECT sum(assignment_submissions.duration) as total_duration
FROM assignment_submissions
JOIN students ON students.id = CAST(student_id AS int)
WHERE students.name = 'Ibrahim Schimmel';
```

* CAUTION: assignment_submissions.student_id is not int type.


Get the total amount of time that all students from a specific cohort have spent on all assignments.

This should work for any cohort but use FEB12 for now.
Select only the total amount of time as a single column.

```sql
SELECT sum(assignment_submissions.duration) as total_duration
FROM assignment_submissions
JOIN students ON students.id = CAST(student_id as int)
JOIN cohorts ON cohorts.id = CAST(cohort_id as int)
WHERE cohorts.name = 'FEB12';
```






## Group By and Having

### Group By

```sql
SELECT students.name as student, count(assignment_submissions.*) as total_submissions
FROM assignment_submissions
JOIN students ON students.id =  CAST(student_id AS int);
```



```sql
SELECT students.name as student, count(assignment_submissions.*) as total_submissions
FROM assignment_submissions
JOIN students ON students.id = CAST(student_id AS int)
GROUP BY students.name;
```


A currently enrolled student has a null end_date.

```sql
SELECT students.name as student, count(assignment_submissions.*) as total_submissions
FROM assignment_submissions
JOIN students ON students.id =  CAST(student_id AS int)
WHERE students.end_date IS NULL
GROUP BY students.name;
```


### HAVING

Let's only return currently enrolled students who's total submissions are less than 100

```sql
SELECT students.name as student, count(assignment_submissions.*) as total_submissions
FROM assignment_submissions
JOIN students ON students.id = CAST(student_id AS int)
WHERE students.end_date IS NULL
GROUP BY students.name
HAVING count(assignment_submissions.*) < 100;
```


#### The HAVING clause is like WHERE but works on aggregated data. Our WHERE clause works on normal data students.end_date and our HAVING clause works on the aggregated data count(assignment_submissions.*).



## BootcampX Queries 3 - Group By

### Get the total number of assignments for each day of bootcamp.

```sql
SELECT day, count(*) as total_assignments 
FROM assignments
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day;
```

### The same query as before, but only return rows where total assignments is greater than or equal to 10.

```sql
SELECT day, count(*) as total_assignments 
FROM assignments
GROUP BY day
HAVING count(*) >= 10
ORDER BY day;
```


### Get all cohorts with 18 or more students.
Select the cohort name and the total students.
Order by total students from smallest to greatest.

```sql
SELECT cohorts.name as cohort_name, count(students.*) AS student_count 
FROM cohorts
JOIN students ON cohorts.id = cohort_id
GROUP BY cohort_name 
HAVING count(students.*) >= 18
ORDER BY student_count;
```


### Total Assignment Submissions
Get the total number of assignment submissions for each cohort.

Select the cohort name and total submissions.
Order the results from greatest to least submissions.

```sql
SELECT cohorts.name, count(assignment_submissions.*) 
FROM assignment_submissions 
JOIN students ON CAST(student_id AS int) = students.id
JOIN cohorts ON students.id = cohorts.id;
```
